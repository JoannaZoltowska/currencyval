Thanks for viewing my GitHub Profile!

I am Joanna-Małgorzata. The Profile you can see here was created because I am a participant of the programming course - Frontend Developer.
I love learning new things and going deeper in subjects I already have knowledge about.

I am an economist, archaeologist and beginner programmer. For many years I worked in an foreign trade company, and then I was an insurance advisor. 
I have very fond memories of working with a company that sells luxury SPA tubs and saunas.



- I'm currently during Front-end Development Course
- I'm diving deep into html, JavaScript and CSS
- I'm looking to collaborate in open-source projects
- I'm looking for job to develop my skills 
- I love l spending time with my  dog 
- I come from Warsaw

My mother tongue is Polish. I know Russian well and English to a sufficient degree (reading documentation and correspondence).

I am interested in unexplained phenomena (UFO) and .... genealogy.
